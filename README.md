# React-ToDo-Folder

A relatively simple to-do application that allows the creation of folders and individual user-generated tasks which can be stored in the user's
folder of choice.  The purpose of creating this application was to practice using the useReducer hook and further my understanding of how to
effectively use React to handle more complex components.
